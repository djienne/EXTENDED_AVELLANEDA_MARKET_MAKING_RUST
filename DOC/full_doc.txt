Extended API Documentation
By using the Extended API, you agree to the Extended Terms & Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the foregoing terms, do not use the Extended API.

Introduction
 This documentation is a work in progress and will be updated regularly based on user feedback and the addition of new functionality.
Welcome to the Extended API Documentation! This guide is designed to assist traders and developers in integrating with our hybrid perpetuals exchange.

Extended operates as a hybrid Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) exchange. While order processing, matching, position risk assessment, and transaction sequencing are handled off-chain, trade settlement occurs on-chain via Starknet.

Extended is designed to operate in a completely trustless manner, enabled by two core principles:

Users retain self-custody of their funds, with all assets held in smart contracts on Starknet. This means Extended has no custodial access to user assets under any circumstances.

On-chain validation of the trading logic ensures that fraudulent or incorrect transactions, including liquidations that are contrary to the on-chain rules, are never permitted.

All transactions that happen on Extended are settled on Starknet. While Starknet does not rely on Ethereum Layer 1 for every individual transaction, it inherits Ethereum’s security by publishing zero-knowledge proofs every few hours. These proofs validate state transitions on Starknet, ensuring the integrity and correctness of the entire system.

Extended's on-chain logic and smart contracts have undergone extensive audits by external security firms. The audit reports are available below:

ChainSecurity.

Public audit competition.

For a deeper breakdown of the core principles that make Extended trustless, see the blog Why Safe. For more on Extended Exchange's roadmap and architecture, check out Extended Vision and Architecture, respectively.

To optimize high-frequency trading performance, the Extended API operates asynchronously. When you place an order, it immediately returns an order ID, even before the order is officially recorded in the book. To track your order status in real time subscribe to the Order WebSocket stream, which delivers instant updates on confirmations, cancellations, and rejections.

StarkEx to Starknet migration
On August 12, 2025, Extended began the migration from StarkEx to Starknet. This transition marks the first step toward our long-term vision of the Extended ecosystem and the introduction of unified margin. You can read more about the broader migration rationale and vision in our documentation.

Existing Extended users will need to migrate from the current StarkEx instance to the new Starknet instance. The migration process has been designed to be as seamless as possible and is explained here. New users will be onboarded directly to the Starknet instance.

For the Starknet instance of the platform, the following changes vs StarkEx apply:

Wallet support: In addition to EVM-compatible wallets, we will also support Starknet-compatible wallets.

Signing logic: New signing logic in line with the SNIP12 standard (EIP712 for Starknet) and examples are available via the SDK.

Deposits and withdrawals: For EVM wallets, we support deposits and withdrawals on six major EVM chains, currently only via the user interface. For Starknet wallets, deposits and withdrawals via Starknet are now supported.

URL: The URL for the Starknet instance is api.starknet.extended.exchange, vs. api.extended.exchange for the StarkEx instance.

The migration will be rolled out in three stages:

Stage 1 – Dual Operation Mode,

Stage 2 – StarkEx Wind-Down Mode,

Stage 3 – StarkEx Freeze.

While the StarkEx instance will remain fully operational during Stage 1 of the migration, certain restrictions will apply starting August 12. Please review them carefully here.

Until the migration is complete, all StarkEx-specific details can be found in the dedicated section of the API documentation.

 The SDK and the SDK documentation will be updated regularly to include additional functionality and more examples.
Getting Started:

For installation instructions, please refer to the description provided.

For reference implementations, explore the examples folder.

For SDK configuration, please refer to the config description.

Supported Features:

Account creation and authorisation.

Order Management.

Account Management.

Transfers.

Withdrawals (for Starknet wallets only).

Market Information.

We are committed to enhancing the SDK with more functionalities based on user feedback and evolving market needs.

Mainnet
Our Mainnet is running on Starknet.

Base URL for the Mainnet API endpoints: https://api.starknet.extended.exchange/.

UI URL: https://app.extended.exchange/perp.

Testnet
Our Testnet is running on Sepolia.

Base URL for the Testnet API endpoints: https://api.starknet.sepolia.extended.exchange/.

UI URL: https://starknet.sepolia.extended.exchange/perp

On the testnet, users can claim $1,000 worth of test USDC per hour for each wallet. This can be done by clicking the 'Claim' button in the 'Account' section, located at the bottom right of the Extended Testnet Trade screen.

Allowed HTTP Verbs
GET: Retrieves a resource or list of resources.

POST: Creates a resource.

PATCH: Updates a resource.

DELETE: Deletes a resource.

Authentication
Due to the trustless, self-custody nature of the Extended exchange, transactions involving user funds require both an API key and a valid Stark signature.

For order management, both an API key and Stark signature are necessary. For other endpoints, only the API key signature is required. Stark signatures are generated using a private Stark key.

Account Creation, API and Stark Key Management
Currently, accounts can be created through the SDK or the User Interface:

SDK - refer to the onboarding example.

User Interface - connect your wallet on extended.exchange to create your Extended account.

You can create up to ten Extended sub-accounts per one wallet address. You can add and manage all sub-accounts associated with your connected wallet in the 'Account' section, located at the bottom right of the Extended Trade screen.

On the API management page, you can obtain API keys, Stark keys, and Vault numbers for each of your sub-accounts. Note that each sub-account is a separate Starknet position and therefore has unique API and Stark keys.

Authenticate Using API Key
Extended uses a simplified authentication scheme for API access. Include your API key in the HTTP header as follows: X-Api-Key: <API_KEY_FROM_API_MANAGEMENT_PAGE_OF_UI>.

Mandatory headers
For both REST and WebSocket API requests, the User-Agent header is required.

Rate Limits
REST API endpoints are subject to rate limits. For real-time data, consider using the WebSockets API instead.

All REST API endpoints are throttled by IP address. Currently, the rate limit is set at 1,000 requests per minute, shared across all endpoints. We plan to increase these limits as our system expands. If you require an increase in the rate limit now, please reach out to our team on Discord.

Higher rate limit of 60,000 requests per 5 minutes apply for the market makers.

When a REST API rate limit is exceeded, a 429 status code will be returned.

Pagination
Paginated response schema:

type PaginatedResponse = {
  "status": "ok" | "error"
  "data": object | object[] | string | number,
  "error": {
    "code": number,
    "message": string
  },
  "pagination": {
    "cursor": number // Current cursor
    "count": number  // Count of the items in the response
  }
}
General not paginated response schema:

type GeneralResponse = {
  "status": "ok" | "error",
  "data": object | object[] | string | number,
  "error": {
    "code": number,
    "message": string
  }
}
The Extended API uses a cursor-based pagination model across all endpoints that may return large volumes of items.

Items are automatically sorted in descending order by ID unless otherwise specified in the endpoint description. As IDs increase over time, the most recent items are always returned first.

Pagination parameters are passed via the query string. These parameters include:

Parameter	Required	Type	Description
cursor	no	number	Determines the offset of the returned result. It represents the ID of the item after which you want to retrieve the next result. To get the next result page, use the cursor from the pagination section of the previous response.
limit	no	number	The maximum number of items that should be returned.

Get balance
HTTP Request
GET /api/v1/user/balance

Get key balance details for the authenticated sub-account. Returns a 404 error if the user’s balance is 0.

Account Balance = Deposits - Withdrawals + Realised PnL.

Equity = Account Balance + Unrealised PnL.

Available Balance for Trading = Equity - Initial Margin Requirement.

Available Balance for Withdrawals = max(0, Wallet Balance + min(0,Unrealised PnL) - Initial Margin Requirement).

Unrealised PnL (mark-price-based) = The sum of unrealised PnL across open positions, calculated as Position Size * (Mark Price - Entry Price).

Unrealised PnL (mid-price-based) = The sum of unrealised PnL across open positions, calculated as Position Size * (Mid Price - Entry Price).

Initial Margin Requirement for a given market = Max(Abs(Position Value + Value of Buy Orders), Abs(Position Value + Value of Sell Orders))*1/Leverage.

Account Margin Ratio = Maintenance Margin requirement of all open positions / Equity. Liquidation is triggered when Account Margin Ratio > 100%.

Account Exposure = Sum(All positions value)

Account Leverage = Exposure / Equity.

Update leverage
HTTP Request
PATCH /api/v1/user/leverage

Update leverage for an individual market.

Modifying your leverage will impact your Available balance and Initial Margin requirements of your open position and orders in the market.

To adjust your leverage, you must meet two requirements:

The total value of your open position and triggered orders must remain below the maximum position value allowed for the selected leverage.

Your Available balance must be sufficient to cover the additional Margin requirements (if any) associated with the new leverage.

Failure to meet either of these criteria will result in an error.

For details on Margin requirements, please refer to the documentation.

{
  "market": "BTC-USD",
  "leverage": "10"
}

Order management
The Private API endpoints listed below allow you to create, cancel, and manage orders from the authenticated sub-account.

Starknet-Specific Logic
Extended settles all transactions on-chain on Starknet. As a result, order creation might differ from centralized exchanges in a few ways:

Stark Key Signature: Required for all order management endpoints. For details, please refer to the reference implementation in the Python SDK.

Price Parameter: All orders, including market orders, require a price as a mandatory parameter.

Fee Parameter: All orders require a fee as a mandatory parameter. The Fee parameter represents the maximum fee a user is willing to pay for an order. Use the maker fee for Post-only orders and the taker fee for all other orders. Enter the fee in decimal format (e.g., 0.1 for 10%). To view current fees, use the Get fees endpoint, which displays applicable fee rates.

Expiration Timestamp: All orders, including Fill or Kill and Immediate or Cancel orders, require an expiration timestamp as a mandatory parameter. When submitting orders via the API, enter the expiration time as an epoch timestamp in milliseconds. On the Mainnet, the maximum allowable expiration time is 90 days from the order creation date. On the Testnet, 28 days from the order creation date.

Market Orders: Extended does not natively support market orders. On the UI, market orders are created as limit Immediate-or-Cancel orders with a price parameter set to ensure immediate execution. For example, Market Buy Orders are set at the best ask price multiplied by 1.0075, and Market Sell Orders at the best bid price multiplied by 0.9925 (subtracting 0.75%).

TPSL Orders: Orders with Take Profit and/or Stop Loss require multiple signatures.

Create or edit order
HTTP Request
POST /api/v1/user/order

Create a new order or edit (replace) an open order. When you create an order via our REST API, the initial response will confirm whether the order has been successfully accepted. Please be aware that, although rare, orders can be canceled or rejected by the Matching Engine even after acceptance at the REST API level. To receive real-time updates on your order status, subscribe to the Account updates WebSocket stream. This stream provides immediate notifications of any changes to your orders, including confirmations, cancellations, and rejections.

Currently, we support limit, market, conditional and tpsl order types via API, along with reduce-only and post-only settings. For API trading, we offer the following Time-in-force settings: GTT (Good till time - default) and IOC (Immediate or cancel). On the Mainnet, the maximum allowable expiration time for GTT orders is 90 days from the order creation date. On the Testnet, 28 days from the order creation date. For details on supported order types and settings, please refer to the documentation.

To successfully place an order, it must meet the following requirements:

Price requirements
Limit Orders
Long Limit Orders: Order Price ≤ Mark Price * (1+Limit Order Price Cap)
Short Limit Orders: Order Price ≥ Mark Price * (1-Limit Order Floor Ratio)
Market Orders
Long Market Order: Order Price ≤ Mark Price * (1 + 5%)
Short Market Order: Order Price ≥ Mark Price * (1 - 5%)
Conditional Orders
Short Conditional Orders: Order Price ≥ Trigger price * (1-Limit Order Floor Ratio)
Long Conditional Orders: Order Price ≤ Trigger Price * (1+Limit Order Price Cap)

Validation	Stop loss	Take profit
Trigger price validation	Trigger price < Entry order price	Trigger price > Entry order price.
Limit price validation	Order Price ≥ Trigger price * (1-Limit Order Floor Ratio)	Order Price ≥ Trigger price * (1-Limit Order Floor Ratio)
Entry order: Sell; TPSL order: Buy.

Validation	Stop loss	Take profit
Trigger price validation	Trigger price > Entry order price.	Trigger price < Entry order price.
Limit price validation	Order Price ≤ Trigger Price * (1+Limit Order Price Cap)	Order Price ≤ Trigger Price * (1+Limit Order Price Cap)
Orders Edit
To edit (replace) an open order, add its ID as the cancelId parameter. You can edit multiple parameters at once. Editing is available for all orders except for triggered TPSL orders.

Order editing and validations:

If any updated parameter fails the validations described above, all updates will be rejected.
If validations fail at the REST API level, the initial open order remains unchanged.
In the rare event that validations pass at the REST API level but fail at the Matching Engine, both the updated order and the initial open order will be cancelled.
Editable Order Parameters:

For All Order Types (except triggered TPSL orders): Order price and Execution Order Price Type (market or limit)
For All Order Types (except untriggered entire position TPSL orders and triggered TPSL orders): Order size
For Conditional and Untriggered TPSL Orders: Trigger price
For Conditional Orders: Trigger price direction (up or down)
For Non-TPSL Orders: All TPSL parameters
Self trade protection
Self-trade protection is a mechanism that prevents orders from the same client or sub-account from executing against each other. When two such orders are about to match, the system applies the self-trade protection mode specified on the taker order to determine how to handle the potential self-match.

Value	Description
DISABLED	Self trade protection is disabled
ACCOUNT	Trades within same sub-account are disabled, trades between sub-accounts are enabled.
CLIENT	Trades within same sub-account and between sub-accounts are disabled.

Commit quote
HTTP Request
POST /api/v1/user/bridge/quote?id=68aaa

Commits a quote for EVM deposit/withdrawal.

If a quote is deemed acceptable it needs to be committed before the bridge can be executed. This tells our bridge provider Rhino.fi to start watching for a transaction on the origin chain that deposits the required funds into the bridge contract. Rhino.fi will then issue a commitment ID to be used when sending the funds to be bridged.

Deposits
For EVM wallets, we support deposits and withdrawals on six major chains via the Rhino.fi bridge—Arbitrum, Ethereum, Base, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Polygon—currently. Please refer to the documentation for transaction limits and estimated processing times.

For Starknet wallets, we support USDC deposits via on-chain interaction and through the User Interface. To deposit on-chain, invoke the Starknet contract at 0x062da0780fae50d68cecaa5a051606dc21217ba290969b302db4dd99d2e9b470.

Extended doesn't charge fees on deposits or withdrawals, but for EVM chains, bridge fees may apply. All deposits and withdrawals are subject to gas fees.

EVM deposit requires bridging, please read Bridge section before proceeding.

EVM deposit consists of four steps:

1) User retrieves supported chains and bridge contracts via GET /bridge/config.

2) User requests a quote via GET /bridge/quote.

3) If the user accepts the bridge fee, they confirm the quote using POST /bridge/quote.

4) Finally, the user calls the depositWithId function on the source chain. See the rhino.fi docs for more details.

 Incorrectly sent funds are non-recoverable by Extended. Follow the execution order exactly as described. When calling depositWithId, use the exact same ID, amount, and token address. Test with a small amount first to ensure everything works correctly.
Withdrawals
For EVM wallets, we support deposits and withdrawals on six major chains—Arbitrum, Ethereum, Base, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Polygon. Please refer to the documentation for transaction limits and estimated processing times.

For Starknet wallets, we support withdrawals via the User Interface and API, as described below.

Note that Available Balance for Withdrawals = max(0, Wallet Balance + min(0,Unrealised PnL) - Initial Margin Requirements).

Extended doesn't charge fees on deposits or withdrawals, but for EVM chains, bridge fees may apply. All deposits and withdrawals are subject to gas fees. Withdrawals are only permitted to wallets that are linked to the authorised account.

EVM withdrawals
EVM withdrawals involve bridging, please read the Bridge section first before proceeding. The withdrawal process consists of four steps:

1) User retrieves supported chains and bridge contracts via GET /bridge/config. 2) User requests a quote with GET /bridge/quote. 3) If the user accepts the bridge fee, they confirm the quote using POST /bridge/quote. 4) Finally, the user submits a Starknet withdrawal with the quoteId to the bridgeStarknetAddress associated with their account. See Account for details.

Starknet withdrawals
To initiate a Starknet withdrawal, send a "Create Withdrawal" request as described below or use the corresponding SDK method, signed with a private L2 key. Starknet withdrawals are only available for accounts created with a Starknet wallet.

Subscribe to the account updates stream.

The initial responses will include comprehensive information about the account, including balance, open positions, and open orders, i.e. everything from GET /v1/user/balance, GET /v1/user/positions, GET /v1/user/orders.

Subsequent responses will contain all updates related to open orders, trades, account balance or open positions in a single message.

The response attributes will align with the responses from the corresponding REST API endpoints: Get trades, Get positions, Get open orders and Get balance. Refer to the Account section for details.
